# Project 1 Planning: The Unofficial Guide

> Write this document before you write any pipeline code.
> Your spec and architecture diagram are what you'll use to direct AI tools (Claude, Copilot, etc.) to generate your implementation — the more specific they are, the more useful the generated code will be.
> Update the Retrieval Approach and Chunking Strategy sections if you change your approach during implementation.
> Update this file before starting any stretch features.

## Domain

Off-campus housing experiences for UDC students. This knowledge is valuable because official UDC channels only provide on-campus housing information. Students rely on word-of-mouth, Reddit, and Google Reviews to find honest information about nearby apartments — this system makes that scattered knowledge searchable.
---

## Documents

<!-- List your specific sources: URLs, subreddit names, forum threads, or file descriptions.
     Aim for at least 10 sources that together cover different subtopics or perspectives within your domain. -->

| # | Source | Description | URL or location |
|---|--------|-------------|-----------------|
1. van_ness_apartments.txt - Student review of Van Ness area apartments
2. tenleytown_housing.txt - Review of Tenleytown area housing
3. reddit_udc_housing_1.txt - Reddit post about off-campus living near Van Ness
4. reddit_udc_housing_2.txt - Reddit thread about UDC off-campus housing options
5. google_review_van_ness_1.txt - Google review of Van Ness apartment complex
6. google_review_tenleytown_1.txt - Google review of Tenleytown housing
7. housing_tips_udc.txt - Student housing tips shared on Discord
8. connecticut_ave_review.txt - Review of Connecticut Avenue apartments
9. albemarle_street_housing.txt - Student review of Albemarle Street housing
10. udc_housing_facebook_group.txt - Facebook group posts about UDC housing

## Chunking Strategy

<!-- How will you split documents into chunks?
     State your chunk size (in tokens or characters), overlap size, and explain why those
     numbers fit the structure of your documents.
     A review-heavy corpus warrants different chunking than a long FAQ. -->

**Chunk size:300 characters**

**Overlap:50 characters**

**Reasoning:Documents are short reviews (1-3 sentences each). 300 characters captures a complete thought without merging unrelated topics. 50-character overlap prevents splitting key facts across boundaries.**

---

## Retrieval Approach

<!-- Which embedding model are you using (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2 via sentence-transformers)?
     How many chunks will you retrieve per query (top-k)?
     If you were deploying this for real users and cost wasn't a constraint, what tradeoffs
     would you weigh in choosing a different embedding model — context length, multilingual
     support, accuracy on domain-specific text, latency? -->

**Embedding model:all-MiniLM-L6-v2 via sentence-transformers (runs locally, no API key needed)**

**Top-k: 4 chunks per query**

**Production tradeoff reflection:would consider OpenAI embeddings for better accuracy, or multilingual models if serving international students. Tradeoffs include cost, latency, and context length.**

---

## Evaluation Plan

<!-- List your 5 test questions with their expected correct answers.
     Questions should be specific enough that you can judge whether the system's response
     is right or wrong. "What are good dining halls?" is too vague.
     "What do students say about wait times at [dining hall name] during lunch?" is testable. -->

| # | Question | Expected answer |
|---|----------|-----------------|
1. Q: What are apartments like near Van Ness? Expected: Close to UDC metro, management issues ~$1800/month
2. Q: When should I start looking for housing near UDC? Expected: February for fall semester
3. Q: What is the best restaurant in DC? Expected: System declines to answer
4. Q: Are there any mold or maintenance problems in UDC off-campus housing? Expected: Mold reports on Connecticut Ave
5. Q: How much does it cost to rent near UDC? Expected: $1500-$2200 depending on area

## Anticipated Challenges

<!-- What could go wrong? Name at least two specific risks with reasoning.
     Consider: noisy or inconsistent documents, missing source attribution, off-topic
     retrieval, chunks that split key information across boundaries. -->

1. Short documents may produce chunks with too little context for accurate semantic matching
2. Generated documents lack real URLs which weakens source attribution credibility
---

## Architecture

<!-- Draw a diagram of your pipeline showing the five stages:
     Document Ingestion → Chunking → Embedding + Vector Store → Retrieval → Generation
     Label each stage with the tool or library you're using.
     You can use ASCII art, a Mermaid diagram, or embed a sketch as an image.
     You'll use this diagram as context when prompting AI tools to implement each stage. -->
Document Ingestion (ingest.py) → Chunking (300 chars, 50 overlap) → Embedding (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) + Vector Store (ChromaDB) → Retrieval (semantic search, top-4) → Generation (Groq llama-3.3-70b-versatile) → Gradio UI
---

## AI Tool Plan

<!-- For each part of the pipeline below, describe:
     - Which AI tool you plan to use (Claude, Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.)
     - What you'll give it as input (which sections of this planning.md, which requirements)
     - What you expect it to produce
     - How you'll verify the output matches your spec

     "I'll use AI to help me code" is not a plan.
     "I'll give Claude my Chunking Strategy section and ask it to implement chunk_text()
     with my specified chunk size and overlap" is a plan. -->

**Milestone 3 — Ingestion and chunking:**
I gave Claude the Chunking Strategy section of this planning.md (chunk size 300, overlap 50) and the list of 10 .txt documents. I asked it to implement ingest.py with a load_documents() function that reads all .txt files from the documents folder and a chunk_document() function using a sliding window of 300 characters with 50-character overlap. I verified the output by running it and confirming 19 chunks were produced across 10 documents.

**Milestone 4 — Embedding and retrieval:**
I gave Claude the Retrieval Approach section (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, ChromaDB, top-k=4) and asked it to implement retriever.py with embed_and_store() and retrieve() functions. I verified by querying "What are apartments like near Van Ness?" and confirming relevant chunks came back with distance scores below 0.5.

**Milestone 5 — Generation and interface:**
I gave Claude the grounding requirement (answer only from retrieved documents, cite sources) and asked it to implement generator.py using Groq llama-3.3-70b-versatile and app.py using Gradio. I verified grounding was working by asking an out-of-scope question ("What is the best restaurant in DC?") and confirming the system declined to answer rather than hallucinating.
